# Core concepts

This section primarily covers theoretical concepts. Feel free to skip it and dive into the exercises instead. As you work through the exercises related to each concept, we'll link back to the theory. This approach may help you understand the material better by showing you exactly where and why these concepts are needed in practice.


// TODO: Remove the separate Core Concepts section. Split it up and add where needed. Improve Quality also
